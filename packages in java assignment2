                              PACKAGES IN JAVA
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder
in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write
a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
 Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
 User-defined Packages (create your own packages)

Built-in Packages
These packages consist of a large number of classes which are a part of
Java API.Some of the commonly used built-in packages are:
1. java.lang: Contains language support classes(e.g classes which
defines primitive data types, math operations). This package is
automatically imported. 2. java.io: Contains classes for supporting input / output operations. 3. java.util: Contains utility classes which implement data
structures like Linked List, Dictionary and support ; for Date / Time
operations. 4. Contains classes for creating Applets. 5. java.awt: Contain classes for implementing the components for
graphical user interfaces (like button , ;menus etc). 6)
6. java.net: Contain classes for supporting networking operations.

Java program of demonstrating use of java.lang package
class JavaLangExample {
public static void main(String args []) {
int a = 20, b =30;
int sum = Math.addExact(a,b);
int max = Math.max(a,b);
double pi = Math.PI;
System.out.printf("Sum = "+sum+", Max = "+max+", PI = "+pi);
}
}
Output:
Sum = 50, Max = 30, PI = 3.141592653589793
Java program of demonstrating use of java.io package
import java.io.Console;
class JavaIOExample {
public static void main(String args []) {
Console cs = System.console();
System.out.println("Enter your name : ");
String name = cs.readLine();
System.out.println("Welcome : "+name);
}
}
Output:
Enter your name : teja
Welcome : teja

Java program of demonstrating use of java.util package
import java.util.Arrays;
class JavaUtilExample {
public static void main(String args []) {
int[] intArray = {10,30,20,50,40};
Arrays.sort(intArray);
System.out.printf("Sorted array : %s", Arrays.toString(intArray));
}
}
Output:
Sorted array : [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

User-defined packages

User-defined packages are those packages that are designed or created
by the developer to categorize classes and packages. They are much
similar to the built-in that java offers. It can be imported into other
classes and used the same as we use built-in packages. But If we omit
the package statement, the class names are put into the default package, which has no name. //write a java program using user defined packages. import java.io.*;
class Greeting {
public void sayHello() {
System.out.println("Hello from mypackage!");
}
}
class Farewell {
public void sayGoodbye() {
System.out.println("Goodbye from mypackage!");
}
}
class ThankYou {
public void sayThanks() {
System.out.println("Thank you from mypackage!");
}
}
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Greeting greet = new Greeting();
greet.sayHello();
Farewell farewell = new Farewell();
farewell.sayGoodbye();
ThankYou thankYou = new ThankYou();
thankYou.sayThanks();
}
}
Output:

Hello from mypackage!
Goodbye from mypackage!
Thank you from mypackage!
